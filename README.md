# Project AgriBot
This theme inspires engineers in the area of agricultural automation.
Agribot uses an autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) to traverse in a simulated Greenhouse environment, find the targeted yield and correctly execute pick-&-place.
The AGV is retrofitted with a customized gripper to plug yields easily, and so is the created environment ensured to compile with the gripper.
The theme is divided into tasks to build the AgriBot system step-by-step within span of 6 months.
